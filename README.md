### Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a professional designer and AI enthusiast. 

## :computer: My past achievements:
- Professional pitch deck maker, I've created many proposals that caught investors' attention and led to fruitful collaborations.
- I've designed UI for mobile and desktop applications.
- I've made over 10000 people happy by making custom art (who knew it's that easy!).


### Now I am on my mission to conquer Python and explore the potential of Machine Learning â€“ one step at a time. ![it works if you work it](https://tenor.com/bATkd.gif)
